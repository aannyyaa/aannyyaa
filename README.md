### Hi, I'm Anya!

I'm a software engineer passionate about utilizing technology to make an impact. I want to apply my technical skills to health care, public health, and biotechnology. Iâ€™m also interested in mobile app development, data visualization, and the Internet of things.

I'm currently working on:
- PocketGov: a civic information mobile app for users to find their elected officials, compare voting records, and follow legislation
- LabSync: a mobile app for laboratory researchers to coordinate experiments and record data
